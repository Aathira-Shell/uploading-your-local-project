From private betas to the most important open source technologies of our time, GitHub is home to all kinds of projects. Developers count on our platform to take their projects to the next level with collaborative tools, uncompromised security, and premier third-party apps. 

If you haven’t started your project on GitHub, uploading your project might feel overwhelming. This course helps you seamlessly upload your local project to GitHub and provides important next steps for managing your project and introducing community involvement. 

## What you'll learn

In this course, you’ll learn how to:

- Identify where your code is stored
- Introduce code to a repository
- Create important Git files like a `.gitignore`
- Identify important next steps to manage your repository and add community involvement

You'll know the answers to questions like:

- How do I move my existing project to GitHub?
- How do I add version control to my project?
- How do I enable collaboration with others?

## What you'll build

At the end of this course, your project will be on GitHub and ready for version control, and have all the collaboration features of GitHub immediately available. You'll have access to issues, pull requests, project boards, wikis and management features.

## Prerequisites

In this course, we assume you understand what a repository is and how to work with files and folders locally. We also assume you have experience using either the command line or can download software to help move files to GitHub. If you need some help with learning GitHub terminology, try taking [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) first.

## Projects used

This course is open-ended, and you can choose which tooling you'd like to use. Some of the options include:

- [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

## Who this course is for

This is a great follow up course from Introduction to GitHub. If you have a project you've been working on and want version control and collaboration features, this is the best course for you.
