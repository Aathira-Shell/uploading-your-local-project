## Moving Your Project to GitHub

This README contains the course flow for the "Moving Your Project to GitHub" course:

### User Registration

- On registration, create an empty repository called `new-project`
- Repository should be public and include `Welcome, check out the issues tab for next steps` in the description field
- Project should have labels for `migration`, `local`, `other`
- _Bonus points if the repo can be named by the student_
- Open the first issue using the text from `responses/01_make-a-plan.md` with the title "Planning the Move to GitHub"

###  Activity 1: Plan the Move

- Working in issue generated by app
- **Student Action:** Student adds a label one of three options:
  - `migration`
  - `local`
  - `other`
- **App response:** App responds based on the labels added
  - If `migration`
    - Then comment with `responses/02_make-a-plan-vcs.md`
  - If `local`
    - Then comment with  `responses/02_make-a-plan-local.md`
  - If `other`
    - Then comment with `responses/02_make-a-plan-other.md`
- The learner will add, remove and change these labels throughout the activity
- Activity 1 concludes when the learner closes the issue
- The final issue should end with either the `local` or `migration` labels. Based on the labels applied, respond as follows and open next issue:
  - If `local`, no action necessary
  - If `migration`, no action necessary
  - If `other`, apply the `local` label and remove `other` label
  - If no labels have been added, apply the `local` label only and comment `03_need-labels.md`

### Activity 2: Prepare the Project
- Issue generated by app using text in `responses/04_prepare.md` with the title "Preparing the project for Git"
- This issue remains open until the push. On the first push (or import) the app will look for a .gitignore and then close this issue.

### Activity 3: Make the Move

- Based on the labels added to issue 1, app generates the  following issue(s):
- If the `local` label was added
 - Issue generated by the app using the text in `responses/05_move-local.md` with the title "Publishing your local project"
- If the `migration` label was added
  -  Issue generated by the app using the text in `responses/05_move-import.md` with the title "Importing your project"
- If both the `local` AND `migration` label are added, then follow the instructions for `local` but add a comment to the issue with  `responses/05_move-both.md` and then add `05_move-import.md` as another comment
- Activity 3 listens for when the student pushes content to the repository
- **App response:** Based on the labels added (migration vs. local), add the following comment after push:
  - If `local` use the text in `responses/06_move-done-local.md`, close the issue and open next issue
  - If imported `migration` comment with `responses/06_move-done-import.md`, close the issue and open the next issue

### Activity 4: Project Settings

- Issue generated by app using the text in `responses/07_settings.md` with the title "Check out these repository settings"
- Activity 4 concludes when the student closes the issue

### Activity 5: Prepare to collaborate

- App looks for the following documents in the repository and responds as appropriate
- **App action:** Does the repository description exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-description-update.md` with the title "Check the repository description"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-description-new.md` with the title "Add a repository description"
- **App action:** Does README exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-README-update.md` with the title "Make the README amazing"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-README-new.md` with the title "Add a README file"
- **App action:** If the repository is public, does a Code of Conduct exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-code-update.md` with the title "Check for updates to the Code of Conduct"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-code-new.md` with  the title "Add a Code of Conduct"
- **App action:** If the repository is public, does a CONTRIBUTING exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-contributing-update.md` with the title "A checklist for CONTRIBUTING"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-contributing-new.md` with the title "Add a CONTRIBUTING guide"
- **App action:** If the repository is public, does a LICENSE exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-license-update.md` with the title "License check-up"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-license-new.md` with the title "Add a License"
- **App action:** If the repository is public, does an ISSUE_TEMPLATE **OR** PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE exist
  - If yes, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-templates-update.md` with the title "Recommendations for Issue and PR templates"
  - If no, open issue with text from `responses/08_collabs-templates-new.md` with the title "Add starter templates to issues and PRs"
- Students will be instructed to close the above issues from their PRs or just close the issues directly when done. Activity concludes when all of these issues are closed.
- **Student Action:** Student creates PR but doesn't associate it with an issue
- **App response:** Comment on PR with text in `responses/09_linking-to-prs.md`

### Activity 6: Saying Goodbye

After Activity 5 is complete, the app should open a new issue using the text in `responses/12_graceful-exit.md` with the title "A few parting words"
- Activity 6 concludes when the learner closes the issue
