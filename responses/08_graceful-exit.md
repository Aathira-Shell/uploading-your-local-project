Congratulations @{{ user.username }}, you've completed this course! :tada:

## What went well

Before I say good-bye, I want to recap all the tasks you've accomplished. You:

- Learned what to do with an empty repo on GitHub :sparkles:
- Created a .gitignore and removed bulky binaries
- Used your favorite local tools to push existing code
- Set your code up in a GitHub repository :fireworks:

## What's Next?

Now that you've moved your Git repository to GitHub, managing your repository is the next step you'll probably want to take. Join the [Community Starter Kit]({{ host }}/courses/community-starter-kit) course to learn how to invite collaborators, setup integrations, add documentation, and define several important settings and features.

There's so much more you can do with GitHub, and you have a solid start. Now...[what will you learn next]({{ host }}/courses)?
