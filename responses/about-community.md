## Step 4: Prepare to collaborate

Public repositories on GitHub have a Community score. This score is based on the documentation, and how easy it would be for new users to help out and contribute to your project.

### Your community score

Your score is currently **{{ health_percentage}}** and can be seen [here]({{community_url}}).

I've opened up issues for each one of the items that you should take action on, and started [a milestone]({{milestoneURL}}) to help you keep track of them.

To continue with best practices for moving to GitHub, close this issue. Don't worry, the milestone will remain open so you can return to it later.
