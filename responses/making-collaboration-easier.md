## Making Collaboration Easier

In public repositories specific files can help the community contribute to an Open Source project. Even though you are using a private repository doesn't mean you project can't benefit from those same files. These files inform and enable contributors to make contributing easier.

I've opened up issues for each one of the items that you should take action on, and started [a milestone]({{milestoneURL}}) to help you keep track of them.

To continue with best practices for moving to GitHub, close this issue. Don't worry, the milestone will remain open so you can return to it later.
